Recently, I started to immerse myself in the world of Kotlin, a modern and versatile programming language that has caught my attention. However, as someone used to Jupyter's interactive environment, which allows for quick iterations and fluid code exploration, I wondered if there was something similar for Kotlin.

To my pleasant surprise, I discovered that there is a Jupyter kernel for Kotlin. This tool combines the power and elegance of Kotlin with the interactivity and ease of use of Jupyter, creating an ideal development environment for learning and experimenting with the language.

In this post, I'll share my experience setting up a Jupyter environment with Kotlin support, and I'll even go a step further, creating a notebook that allows you to work with multiple languages simultaneously.

## Creating a Kotlin container

Installing the Kotlin kernel for Jupyter is relatively straightforward, especially if we use Docker to create a controlled and reproducible environment. Let's look at the Dockerfile I created for this purpose - check the comments to understand each step:

### Dockerfile

We start with an official Jupyter image downloaded from quay.io. We use a specific version to ensure reproducibility and label the image as `kotlin-kernel` for easy identification.

```docker
FROM quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook:2024-12-31 AS kotlin-kernel
```

We install OpenJDK 21, required to run Kotlin, install as root to avoid permissions issues and then switch to the non-root user to ensure the security of the image.

```docker
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install openjdk-21-jdk

USER jovyan
```

We install the Kotlin kernel for Jupyter, this will allow us to run Kotlin code on our notebook.

```docker
RUN pip install --user
    kotlin-jupyter-kernel==0.12.0.322
```

Create a directory to store the notebooks.

```docker
RUN mkdir -p /home/jovyan/notebooks
```

Finally, we set the `NOTEBOOK_ARGS` environment variable that allows us to configure the notebook with the options we need, in this case, we don't want a browser to open automatically and we want the notebooks directory to be `/home/jovyan/notebooks`.

```docker
ENV NOTEBOOK_ARGS="--no-browser --notebook-dir=/home/jovyan/notebooks"
```

To build the Docker image, we run:

```bash
docker build --target kotlin-kernel -t kotlin-kernel .
```

This command builds the Docker image and labels it as ``kotlin-kernel`.

To run the container:

```bash
docker run \
    -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $(pwd)/notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks \
    kotlin-kernel
```

This command:
- Runs the container in interactive mode (`-it`).
- Map port 8888 of the container to port 8888 of the host (`-p 8888:8888`).
- Mount the local `notebooks` directory in the container's `:/home/jovyan/notebooks` directory (`-v $(pwd)/notebooks::/home/jovyan/notebooks`).

Once executed, you will be able to access JupyterLab in your browser and you will see that the Launcher already has two kernels available: Python and Kotlin.

And in fact, we can already create notebooks with Kotlin!

## The next step in interactivity

As I dug deeper into Kotlin, I noticed some interesting similarities with Python. This led me to want to visualise these similarities in more detail, creating direct comparisons between the two languages. I wondered if it would be possible to run Python and Kotlin code on the same notebook, and it turns out that it is possible.

I discovered an extension (and Jupyter kernel) called SoS (Script of Scripts) that allows this functionality. I decided to add it to my container with the Kotlin kernel. Here are the additions to the Dockerfile:

### Updating the Dockerfile

We install SoS, which will allow us to run Python and Kotlin code on the same notebook.

```docker
RUN pip install --user \
    sos-notebook==0.24.4 \
    jupyterlab-sos==0.11.0 \
    sos==0.25.1 && \
    python -m sos_notebook.install
```

With these additions, we can now build and run our enhanced container:

```bash
docker build -t jupyter-kotlin .

docker run \
    -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $(pwd)/notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks \
    jupyter-kotlin
```

When you access JupyterLab now, you will see three available kernels: Python, Kotlin and SoS.

And now we can run Python and Kotlin code on the same notebook:

## Extra customisation

To improve the visual experience and to easily distinguish between the cells of different languages, I decided to customize the appearance of the cells.

Jupyter Notebook allows adding custom CSS, which allows us to add gradients to the left of each cell, depending on the language.

Here is the CSS I used:

```css
div[class*="sos_lan__python"] { 
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255,222,87,1) 10px, rgba(69,132,182,1) 10px, rgba(69,132,182,1) 20px, rgba(254,254,254,254,1) 20px);
}
div[class*="sos_lan__kotlin"] {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(180,140,140,252,1) 0px, rgba(196,22,224,1) 6px, rgba(223,73,107,1) 16px, rgba(223,73,107,1) 20px, rgba(255,255,255,1) 20px)
}
```

To implement this customisation, I saved the CSS in a file called `custom.css` and added it to the Dockerfile:

```docker
# Copy the custom.css file
COPY custom.css ${HOME}/.jupyter/custom/custom.css
```

In addition, it is necessary to specify to the `jupyter lab` command that we want to use this custom CSS by adding the `--custom-css` flag to the run command.

```docker
ENV NOTEBOOK_ARGS="${NOTEBOOK_ARGS} --custom-css"
```

## Errors and how to hide them

While using the multi-language kernel, occasionally an error appears when running a Kotlin cell. This error is displayed randomly, and although I have not yet been able to identify its source and how to resolve it definitively, I have found a temporary solution to improve the user experience.

![Kotlin bug](https://ik.imagekit.io/thatcsharpguy/posts/docker/kotlin-kernel/kotlin-with-error?updatedAt=1735659310180)

To hide this annoying error, I decided to use CSS. I added the following line to the `custom.css` file mentioned above:

```css
div[class*="sos_lan__kotlin"] div[data-mime-type="application/vnd.jupyter.stderr"] { 
	display: none; 
}
```

This line of CSS hides Kotlin-specific error messages on the notebook. While not an ideal solution, as it might hide important bugs, it significantly improves the visual experience when working with Kotlin notebooks, especially when dealing with this recurring and seemingly harmless error.

## Conclusion

In this post, we have explored how to create an interactive development environment for Kotlin using Jupyter Notebooks.

We started with the basic setup of a Docker container with Kotlin support, then moved on to a more sophisticated environment that allows code execution in multiple languages within the same notebook.

In addition, we have seen how to customise the look and feel of our notebooks to improve the visual experience and readability, and how to _"hide"_ some common bugs that may arise during the use of these notebooks.

This not only makes it easier to learn Kotlin, but also allows for direct comparisons with other languages such as Python, which can be extremely useful for developers who are transitioning to Kotlin or who regularly work with multiple programming languages.

## Additional resources

For those interested in further exploring or replicating this environment, I have made available all the code used in [this project on my GitHub repository](https://github.com/fferegrino/jupyter-kotlin).

I hope you find this guide useful in your learning journey with Kotlin and Jupyter.
