This is a sample gallery collection to demonstrate the photo gallery functionality. You can replace this with your own photography collections by creating new `.mdx` files in the `src/content/gallery/` directory.

## How to add your own galleries:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/gallery/`
2. Use the frontmatter structure shown above
3. Add your image URLs (can be external hosting like Unsplash, your own CDN, etc.)
4. Include captions and alt text for accessibility
5. Set appropriate categories and priorities for sorting

The masonry layout will automatically handle different image orientations and sizes, creating a beautiful, Pinterest-style gallery layout.
